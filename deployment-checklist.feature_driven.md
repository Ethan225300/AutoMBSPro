# Precision Optimization Deployment Checklist

## Configuration: Feature-Driven Optimization
**Expected Gain**: +20-25%
**Risk Level**: Medium

## Pre-deployment
- [ ] Backup current configuration
- [ ] Ensure test environment available
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan

## Deployment Steps
- [ ] 1. Backup current .env file
- [ ] 2. Copy ./env.optimized.feature_driven to .env
- [ ] 3. Apply ranker weights from ./ranker-weights.feature_driven.patch.ts
- [ ] 4. Restart API server
- [ ] 5. Run coverage-aware evaluation
- [ ] 6. Compare metrics against baseline
- [ ] 7. Monitor for 24h before full deployment

## Post-deployment Validation  
- [ ] Run full evaluation suite
- [ ] Verify precision improvement
- [ ] Check latency impact
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Collect user feedback

## Success Criteria
- [ ] precision_improvement: >= 10%
- [ ] recall_maintained: >= current level
- [ ] confidence_calibration: < 15% error
- [ ] latency_impact: < 5% increase

## Rollback Triggers
- [ ] Precision decreases > 5%
- [ ] Recall decreases > 10%
- [ ] Latency increases > 20%
- [ ] System errors increase
